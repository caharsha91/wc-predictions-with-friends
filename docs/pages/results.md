# Results Page

## Route
Results is now an inline section on Picks:
- Canonical: `/play/picks`
- Legacy: `/results` redirects to `/play/picks`

## Purpose
Review finished matches, your picks, and scoring points from the inline Finished matches section on Picks.
Use Play Center (`/play`) for guided pick submission; use Picks for quick edits and result review.

## Key behavior
- Finished matches appears as a separate accordion category in Picks.
- Compact table shows match, your pick, result, and total points.
- Section is collapsed by default to keep picks action-first.
